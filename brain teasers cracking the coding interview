You have 20 bottles of pills. 19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills of weight 1.1 grams. Given a scale that provides an exact measurement, how would you find the heavy bottle? You can only use the scale once.

6.1 solution

Firstly, number the bottles as #1, #2, ..., #20

Secondly, as there is only one bottle that is 0.1 gram heavier than others, we can pick out different pills in that rule:

bottle #1, 1 pill

bottle #2, 2 pills

...

bottle #20, 20 pills

Add all of them above, and substract (1+2+...+20) = 210, e.g. the result is 1.1, then is the bottle #11 that have 1.1 grams pills.

There is an 8x8 chess board in which two diagonally opposite corners have been cut off. You are given 31 dominos, and a single domino can cover exactly two squares. Can you use the 31 dominos to cover the entire board? Prove your answer (by providing an example or showing why it's impossible).

6.2 solution:

Very skillful, color the chess to 32 white and 32 black, since the opposite corners must be the same color, so after removing such two corners, it may be 30 white and 32 black left. Any domino covers one black and one white, so it could be impossible.

You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

6.3 solution:

Old question. I had seen it several years ago.

Firstly, fill 5-quart up. Then, pour 5-quart into 3-quart until it is full. At that time, it's 2 quart left in 5-quart jug.And then, empty the 3-quart and pour the left 2 quart into the 3-quart. Lastly, fill 5-quart jug up and pour it until the 3-quart jug full. At that time it's 4 quart left in 5-quart jug.

A bunch of people are living on an island, when a visitor comes with a strange order: all blue-eyed people must leave the island as soon as possible. There will be a flight out at 8:00pm every evening. Each person can see everyone else's eye color, but they do not know their own (nor is anyone allowed to tell them). Additionally, they do not know how many people have blue eyes, although they do know that at least one person does. How many days will it take the blue-eyed people to leave?

There is a building of 100 floors. If an egg drops from the Nth floor or above, it will break. If it's dropped from any floor below, it will not break. You're given two eggs. Find N, while minimizing the number of drops for the worst case.

There are 100 closed lockers in a hallway. A man begins by opening all 100 lockers. Next, he closes every second locker. Then, on his third pass, he toggles every third locker (closes it if it is open or opens it if it is closed). This process continues for 100 passes, such that on each pass i, the man toggles every ith locker. After his 100th pass in the hallway, in which he toggles only locker #100, how many lockers are open.
Suppose you're in a hallway lined with 100 closed lockers. 
You begin by opening every locker. Then you close every second locker. Then you go to every third locker and open it (if it's closed) or close it (if it's open). Let's call this action toggling a locker. Continue toggling every nth locker on pass number n. After 100 passes, where you toggle only locker #100, how many lockers are open?

Answer
Answer: 10 lockers are left open: 
Lockers #1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100. 
Each of these numbers are perfect squares. This problem is based on the factors of the locker number. 
Each locker is toggled by each factor; for example, locker #40 is toggled on pass number 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, and 40. That's eight toggles: open-closed-open-closed-open-closed-open-closed.

The only way a locker could be left open is if it is toggled an odd number of times. The only numbers with an odd number of factors are the perfect 
squares. Thus, the perfect squares are left open. 

For example, locker #25 is toggled on pass number 1, 5, and 25 (three toggles): open-closed-open.
