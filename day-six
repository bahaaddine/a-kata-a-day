Vasya the clerk at the movie theatre -

The new "Avengers" movie has just been released! There are a lot of people at the cinema box office standing in a huge line. Each of them has a single 100, 50 or 25 dollars bill. A "Avengers" ticket costs 25 dollars.

Vasya is currently working as a clerk. He wants to sell a ticket to every single person in this line.

Can Vasya sell a ticket to each person and give the change if he initially has no money and sells the tickets strictly in the order people follow in the line?

Return YES, if Vasya can sell a ticket to each person and give the change. Otherwise return NO.

###Examples:

// === JavaScript ==

tickets([25, 25, 50]) // => YES 
tickets([25, 100])    
        // => NO. Vasya will not have enough money to give change to 100 dollars

 Thoughts:
 1. We loop through the array and check each index in order, from left to right. 
 2. If the amount [i] is greater than 25, and he has no change in the bank, return false or 'NO'
 3. So for each index that made it through - we receive $25 in the bank, so we can multiply each index by 25, add 1 to the index so we don't get 0 first time
 4. Check if money in bank minus change required is greater than 0, and if it is, return 'Yes', other wise return 'No'
 
 Solution: 
 
 function tickets(peopleInLine){
    for (let i = 0; i < peopleInLine.length; i++) {
        if (peopleInLine[i] > 25) {
            let changeRequired = peopleInLine[i] - 25
            let moneyInBack = (peopleInLine.indexOf(peopleInLine[i]) + 1) * 25
            return (moneyInBack - changeRequired > 0) ? 'YES' : 'NO'
        }
    }
    peopleInLine;
}
